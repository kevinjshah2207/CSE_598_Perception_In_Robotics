# CSE_598_Perception_In_Robotics
This repository is a cumulation of 3 ROS based Robotics Perception projects completed during my first Semester at ASU

1. My Initials in ROS

This project involved using the Turtlesim package in ROS to draw the initial of my last name

2. Camera Model and Stereo Depth Sensing

This project focused on the camera models, calibrating multiple view geometry, stereo calibration and rectification, sparse depth triangulation and dense depth triangulation.

3. Pursuit Evasion Game

It uses SLAM using the gmapping package in ROS to create maps of the simulated world and use these maps for navigation tasks as well as to avoid obstacles during navigation. These methods can also be used to map real-world environments. Turtlebot3 acts as a Pursuer and the human model as an Evader.
